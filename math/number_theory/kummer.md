# Kummer's Theorm

[Kummer's theorm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kummer%27s_theorem) gives the exponent of the highest power of a prime number p dividing this binomial coefficient.

Kummer's theorem states that for given integers n ≥ m ≥ 0 and a prime number p, the p-adic valuation $${\displaystyle \nu _{p}\left({\tbinom {n}{m}}\right)} {\displaystyle \nu _{p}\left({\tbinom {n}{m}}\right)}$$ is equal to the number of carries when m is added to n − m in base p.

It can be proved by writing $${\displaystyle {\tbinom {n}{m}}} {\tbinom  {n}{m}}$$ as $${\displaystyle {\tfrac {n!}{m!(n-m)!}}} {\tfrac  {n!}{m!(n-m)!}}$$ and using Legendre's formula.
