# Tensor Networks

[Back](../../index.md#math){: .button}

Tensor Networks (Penrose diagrams) are visual diagrams to represent Tensor operations. The idea behind using a visual representations is that you can study and optimize these networks. These networks are also perhaps with some minor differences, **string diagrams. **String diagrams have been used in category theory to prove things (Curry Howard correspondence). Also formal proofs can be used to generalize optimizations
