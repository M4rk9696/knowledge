# 3D Rotation

[Back](../math.md{: .button}

In certain cases rotation of the axis with rotate was not possible.
This was because of `Gimbal lock`, Gimbal lock is the loss of one degree of freedom. In that case we need to rely on 3D rotation

Rotation in 3D is more complicated than standard 2D rotation, refer to the links to understand more about 3D rotation
