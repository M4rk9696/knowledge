# Rule of Zero and Rule of Five

[Back](./cplusplus.md){: .button}

## Rule of Zero

Classes that have custom destructors, copy/move assignment should deal with ownership exclusively. Other classes should not have touch with the ownership

```cpp
class Test {
  std::vector arr;
  public:
  Test(std::vector arr) : arr(arr) {}; // We rely on std::vector to manage it's own resources
};
```

## Rule of Five

When creating a class which is going to manage it's own resources 
always define these 5 member functions
2. Destructor
3. Copy Ctor
3. Copy Assignment
4. Move Ctor
5. Move Assignment
