# Profile Guided Optimization

[Back](./c-compiler.md){: .button}

```
# Compile with flag -fprofile-generate
gcc -omain main.c -O3 -fprofile-generate=<dir>

# Generate profile for the execution
./main

# Use the generated profile to optimize the binary
gcc -omain main.c -O3 -fprofile-use=<dir>
```

> **Note:** The profiling build is run on multiple inputs to generate a profile that resembles the actual workload. Coverage with `gprof` is used to help with this step
