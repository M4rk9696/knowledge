# Fortify Source

[Back](./c-compiler.md)

The `_FORTIFY_SOURCE` macro adds compiler time and run time checks for buffer overflows and memory sanity.

```
gcc -o test test.c -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2
```

Available levels

**\_FORTIFY\_SOURCE=1**
**\_FORTIFY\_SOURCE=2**
**\_FORTIFY\_SOURCE=3** emits code to check buffer overflows at runtime

At higher levels of fortify source there is a penalty on build size and performance.
