# Frame Pointer

[Back](../../index.md){: .button}

Frame pointer points to the base of the stack trace. This is done by having a dedicated 
register allocated just for the frame pointer.

In compilers the frame pointer can be exposed for benchmarking purposes by adding the compiler flag `-fnoomit-frame-pointer`, this improves the call graph
