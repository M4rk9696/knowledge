## Translation of intrinsics

### Behaviour of storeu and loadu

GCC's default tuning (-mtune=generic) includes -mavx256-split-unaligned-load and -mavx256-split-unaligned-store, because that gives a minor speedup on some CPUs (e.g. first-gen Sandybridge, and some AMD CPUs) in some cases when memory is actually misaligned at runtime
